    "\"We've detected some temporal anomalies,\" one of Santa's Elves at the Temporal Anomaly Research and Detection Instrument Station tells you. She sounded pretty worried when she called you down here. \"At 500-year intervals into the past, someone has been changing Santa's history!\"\n",
    "\n",
    "\"The good news is that the changes won't propagate to our time stream for another 25 days, and we have a device\" - she attaches something to your wrist - \"that will let you fix the changes with no such propagation delay. It's configured to send you 500 years further into the past every few days; that was the best we could do on such short notice.\"\n",
    "\n",
    "\"The bad news is that we are detecting roughly fifty anomalies throughout time; the device will indicate fixed anomalies with stars. The other bad news is that we only have one device and you're the best person for the job! Good lu--\" She taps a button on the device and you suddenly feel like you're falling. To save Christmas, you need to get all fifty stars by December 25th.\n",
    "\n",
    "Collect stars by solving puzzles. Two puzzles will be made available on each day in the advent calendar; the second puzzle is unlocked when you complete the first. Each puzzle grants one star. Good luck!\n",
    "\n",
    "After feeling like you've been falling for a few minutes, you look at the device's tiny screen. \"Error: Device must be calibrated before first use. Frequency drift detected. Cannot maintain destination lock.\" Below the message, the device shows a sequence of changes in frequency (your puzzle input). A value like +6 means the current frequency increases by 6; a value like -3 means the current frequency decreases by 3.\n",
    "\n",
    "For example, if the device displays frequency changes of +1, -2, +3, +1, then starting from a frequency of zero, the following changes would occur:\n",
    "\n",
    "    Current frequency  0, change of +1; resulting frequency  1.\n",

    "You stop falling through time, catch your breath, and check the screen on the device. \"Destination reached. Current Year: 1518. Current Location: North Pole Utility Closet 83N10.\" You made it! Now, to find those anomalies.\n",
    "\n",
    "Outside the utility closet, you hear footsteps and a voice. \"...I'm not sure either. But now that so many people have chimneys, maybe he could sneak in that way?\" Another voice responds, \"Actually, we've been working on a new kind of suit that would let him fit through tight spaces like that. But, I heard that a few days ago, they lost the prototype fabric, the design plans, everything! Nobody on the team can even seem to remember important details of the project!\"\n",
    "\n",
    "\"Wouldn't they have had enough fabric to fill several boxes in the warehouse? They'd be stored together, so the box IDs should be similar. Too bad it would take forever to search the warehouse for two similar box IDs...\" They walk too far away to hear any more.\n",
    "\n",
    "Late at night, you sneak to the warehouse - who knows what kinds of paradoxes you could cause if you were discovered - and use your fancy wrist device to quickly scan every box and produce a list of the likely candidates (your puzzle input).\n",
    "\n",
    "To make sure you didn't miss any, you scan the likely candidate boxes again, counting the number that have an ID containing exactly two of any letter and then separately counting those with exactly three of any letter. You can multiply those two counts together to get a rudimentary checksum and compare it to what your device predicts.\n",
    "\n",
    "For example, if you see the following box IDs:\n",
    "\n",
    "    abcdef contains no letters that appear exactly two or three times.\n",
    "    bababc contains two a and three b, so it counts for both.\n",
    "    abbcde contains two b, but no letter appears exactly three times.\n",
    "    abcccd contains three c, but no letter appears exactly two times.\n",
    "    aabcdd contains two a and two d, but it only counts once.\n",
    "    abcdee contains two e.\n",
    "    ababab contains three a and three b, but it only counts once.\n",

    "\n",
    "The Elves play this game by taking turns arranging the marbles in a circle according to very particular rules. The marbles are numbered starting with 0 and increasing by 1 until every marble has a number.\n",
    "\n",
    "First, the marble numbered 0 is placed in the circle. At this point, while it contains only a single marble, it is still a circle: the marble is both clockwise from itself and counter-clockwise from itself. This marble is designated the current marble.\n",
    "\n",
    "Then, each Elf takes a turn placing the lowest-numbered remaining marble into the circle between the marbles that are 1 and 2 marbles clockwise of the current marble. (When the circle is large enough, this means that there is one marble between the marble that was just placed and the current marble.) The marble that was just placed then becomes the current marble.\n",
    "\n",
    "However, if the marble that is about to be placed has a number which is a multiple of 23, something entirely different happens. First, the current player keeps the marble they would have placed, adding it to their score. In addition, the marble 7 marbles counter-clockwise from the current marble is removed from the circle and also added to the current player's score. The marble located immediately clockwise of the marble that was removed becomes the new current marble.\n",
    "\n",
    "For example, suppose there are 9 players. After the marble with value 0 is placed in the middle, each player (shown in square brackets) takes a turn. The result of each of those turns would produce circles of marbles like this, where clockwise is to the right and the resulting current marble is in parentheses:\n",

These are written as `LLCRR =>` N, where L are pots to the left, C is the current pot being considered, R are the pots to the right, and N is whether the current pot will have a plant in the next generation. For example:\n",

They do this based on their current location: carts on the top row move first (acting from left to right), then carts on the second row move (again from left to right), then carts on the third row, and so on. Once each cart has moved one step, the process repeats; each of these loops is called a tick.\n",

    "# Day 19: Go With The Flow \n",
    "With the Elves well on their way constructing the North Pole base, you turn your attention back to understanding the inner workings of programming the device.\n",
    "\n",
    "You can't help but notice that the device's opcodes don't contain any flow control like jump instructions. The device's manual goes on to explain:\n",
    "\n",
    "\"In programs where flow control is required, the instruction pointer can be bound to a register so that it can be manipulated directly. This way, setr/seti can function as absolute jumps, addr/addi can function as relative jumps, and other opcodes can cause truly fascinating effects.\"\n",
    "\n",
    "This mechanism is achieved through a declaration like #ip 1, which would modify register 1 so that accesses to it let the program indirectly access the instruction pointer itself. To compensate for this kind of binding, there are now six registers (numbered 0 through 5); the five not bound to the instruction pointer behave as normal. Otherwise, the same rules apply as the last time you worked with this device.\n",
    "\n",
    "When the instruction pointer is bound to a register, its value is written to that register just before each instruction is executed, and the value of that register is written back to the instruction pointer immediately after each instruction finishes execution. Afterward, move to the next instruction by adding one to the instruction pointer, even if the value in the instruction pointer was just updated by an instruction. (Because of this, instructions must effectively set the instruction pointer to the instruction before the one they want executed next.)\n",
    "\n",
    "The instruction pointer is 0 during the first instruction, 1 during the second, and so on. If the instruction pointer ever causes the device to attempt to load an instruction outside the instructions defined in the program, the program instead immediately halts. The instruction pointer starts at 0.\n",
    "\n",
    "It turns out that this new information is already proving useful: the CPU in the device is not very powerful, and a background process is occupying most of its time. You dump the background process' declarations and instructions to a file (your puzzle input), making sure to use the names of the opcodes rather than the numbers.\n",
    "\n",

    "- The instruction pointer contains 0, and so the first instruction is executed (seti 5 0 1). It updates register 0 to the current instruction pointer value (0), sets register 1 to 5, sets the instruction pointer to the value of register 0 (which has no effect, as the instruction did not modify register 0), and then adds one to the instruction pointer.\n",
    "- The instruction pointer contains 1, and so the second instruction, seti 6 0 2, is executed. This is very similar to the instruction before it: 6 is stored in register 2, and the instruction pointer is left with the value 2.\n",
    "- The instruction pointer is 2, which points at the instruction addi 0 1 0. This is like a relative jump: the value of the instruction pointer, 2, is loaded into register 0. Then, addi finds the result of adding the value in register 0 and the value 1, storing the result, 3, back in register 0. Register 0 is then copied back to the instruction pointer, which will cause it to end up 1 larger than it would have otherwise and skip the next instruction (addr 1 2 3) entirely. Finally, 1 is added to the instruction pointer.\n",
    "- The instruction pointer is 4, so the instruction setr 1 0 0 is run. This is like an absolute jump: it copies the value contained in register 1, 5, into register 0, which causes it to end up in the instruction pointer. The instruction pointer is then incremented, leaving it at 6.\n",

If the test passes, the program continues, and assumes that all other bitwise operations (banr, bori, and borr) also interpret their inputs as numbers.
